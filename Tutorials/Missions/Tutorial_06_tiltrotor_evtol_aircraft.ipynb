    "## Vehicle Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "The **`vehicle_setup`** function defines the baseline configuration of the aircraft. This section builds the vehicle step-by-step by specifying its components, geometric properties, and high-level parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Creating the Vehicle Instance\n",
    "\n",
    "The setup begins by creating a vehicle instance and assigning it a **tag**. The tag is a unique string identifier used to reference the vehicle during analysis or in post-processing steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Defining High-Level Vehicle Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "The high-level parameters describe the aircraft’s key operational characteristics, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Maximum Takeoff Weight**: The heaviest allowable weight of the aircraft for safe flight.\n",
    "- **Operating Empty Weight**: The aircraft weight without fuel, passengers, or payload.\n",
    "- **Payload**: The weight of cargo and passengers.\n",
    "- **Max Zero Fuel Weight**: The maximum weight of the aircraft excluding fuel.\n",
    "\n",
    "Units for these parameters can be converted automatically using the `Units` module to ensure consistency and reduce errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Defining the Landing Gear\n",
    "\n",
    "Landing gear parameters, such as the number of main and nose wheels, are set for the aircraft. While not used in this tutorial, these values can be applied in advanced analyses, such as **ground loads** or **noise prediction**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Main Wing Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "The main wing is added using the **`Main_Wing`** class. This designation ensures that the primary lifting surface is recognized correctly by the analysis tools. Key properties of the wing include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Area**: The total wing surface area.\n",
    "- **Span**: The length of the wing from tip to tip.\n",
    "- **Aspect Ratio**: A ratio of span to average chord, determining wing efficiency.\n",
    "- **Segments**: Divisions of the wing geometry (e.g., root and tip sections).\n",
    "- **Control Surfaces**: High-lift devices like flaps and ailerons, defined by span fractions and deflections.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Horizontal and Vertical Stabilizers\n",
    "\n",
    "The stabilizers provide stability and control for the aircraft:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Horizontal Stabilizer**: Defined using the `Horizontal_Tail` class. It follows a similar setup to the main wing but acts as a stabilizing surface.\n",
    "- **Vertical Stabilizer**: Defined using the `Vertical_Tail` class, with an additional option to designate the tail as a **T-tail** for weight calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Fuselage Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "The fuselage is modeled by specifying its geometric parameters, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Length**: The overall length of the aircraft body.\n",
    "- **Width**: The widest part of the fuselage cross-section.\n",
    "- **Height**: The height of the fuselage.\n",
    "\n",
    "These values influence drag calculations and overall structural weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Energy Network\n",
    "\n",
    "The **energy network** models the propulsion system. The energy network determines the engine’s thrust, bypass ratio, and fuel type. These parameters are essential for performance and fuel efficiency analyses.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Analyses Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "The **`analyses_setup`** function assigns a set of analyses to each vehicle configuration. Analyses are used to evaluate the aircraft’s performance, aerodynamics, energy systems, and other characteristics for a given configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Overview of Analyses Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, **all configurations** share the same set of analyses. However, this function provides the flexibility to assign a unique set of analyses to any specific configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Purpose of Analyses Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "The analyses ensure that the defined vehicle configurations (e.g., **cruise**, **takeoff**, **landing**) are evaluated correctly during the simulation. Each configuration can have:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Common Analyses**: Shared across multiple configurations for simplicity.\n",
    "- **Custom Analyses**: Tailored to a specific phase of flight or performance evaluation.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 3. Typical Analyses Included\n",
    "\n",
    "The following analyses are typically assigned to each configuration:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Weights Analysis**: Computes weight distribution across components.\n",
    "- **Aerodynamics Analysis**: Estimates lift, drag, and aerodynamic coefficients.\n",
    "- **Stability Analysis**: Evaluates stability derivatives for flight control assessments.\n",
    "- **Energy Analysis**: Runs the energy network (e.g., turboprop engine) for thrust and fuel performance.\n",
    "- **Atmosphere Analysis**: Sets atmospheric conditions using standard atmospheric models.\n",
    "\n",
    "By assigning these analyses, the vehicle's behavior under different configurations (e.g., **cruise**, **takeoff**, **landing**) can be comprehensively evaluated.\n",

    "### 4. Customizing Analyses\n",
    "\n",
    "To assign a **custom analysis set** for a specific configuration:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define a new analysis function tailored to the desired evaluation.\n",
    "2. Replace the default analyses for the target configuration by calling the custom function.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the **takeoff configuration** might use a modified aerodynamic analysis to account for flap and slat deployment.\n",

    "\n",
    "Common segments in a mission profile include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Taxi**: Ground movement of the aircraft before takeoff and after landing.\n",
    "- **Takeoff**: Acceleration and lift-off phase with high-lift devices deployed.\n",
    "- **Climb**: Gradual ascent to cruise altitude, often with reduced flap/slat deployment.\n",
    "- **Cruise**: Level flight at a constant altitude and speed for fuel-efficient operation.\n",
    "- **Descent**: Controlled reduction in altitude as the aircraft prepares for landing.\n",
    "- **Landing**: Final phase of flight with maximum flap and slat deployment for touchdown.\n",
